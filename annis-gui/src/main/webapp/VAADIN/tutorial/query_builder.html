<h2>Using the ANNIS Query Builder</h2>
<p>To open the graphical query builder, click on the <strong>Query Builder</strong> tab. On the left-hand side of the toolbar at the top of the query builder canvans, you will see the <strong>Add Node</strong> button.
Use this button to define nodes to be searched for (tokens, non-terminal nodes or annotations). Creating nodes and modifying them on the canvas will immediately update the AnnisQL field in the Search Form with your query, though updating the query on the Search Form will not create a new graph in the Query Builder. </p>

<p>In each node you create you may click on  <img src="list-add.png" alt="The Add Node button"> to specify an annotation value. The annotation name can be typed in or selected from a drop down list. The operator field in the middle allows you to choose between an exact match
(the '=' symbol) or wildcard search using Regular Expressions (the '~' symbol). The annotation value is given on the right, and should <strong>NOT</strong> be surrounded by quotations (see the example below).
It is also possible to specify multiple annotations applying to the same position by clicking on <img src="list-add.png" alt="The Add Node button"> multiple times. Clicking on <img src="edit-clear.png" alt="The Clear all nodes button"> will delete the values in the node.
To search for word forms, simply choose "tok" as the field name on the left. A node with no data entered will match any node, that is an underspecified token or non-terminal node or annotation.</p>

<p>
To specify the relationship between nodes, first click on the "Add Edge" link at the top left of one node, and then click the "Dock" link which becomes available on the other nodes.
An edge will connect the nodes with an extra box from which operators may be selected (see below). For operators allowing additional labels (e.g. the dominance operator <tt>&gt;</tt> allows edge labels to be specified),
you may type directly into the edge's operator box, as in the example with a "func" label in the image below. Note that the node clicked on first (where the "Edge" button was clicked) will be the first node in the resulting
quey, i.e. if this is the first node it will dominate the second node (<tt>#1 &gt; #2</tt>) and not the other way around, as also represented by the arrows along the edge.</p>
