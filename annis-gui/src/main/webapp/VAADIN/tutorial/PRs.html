<h2>Searching for Pointing Relations</h2>
<p>Pointing relations are used to express an arbitrary directed
relationship between two elements (terminals or non-terminals) without
implying dominance or coverage inheritance.  For instance, in the pcc2
demo corpus, elements in the <tt>mmax:</tt> namespace may point to
each other to express coreference or anaphoric relations.  The
following query searches for two <tt>np_form</tt> annotations, which
specify for example whether a nominal phrase is pronominal, definite
or indefinite.
</p>
<tt>mmax:np_form="pper" & <br>mmax:np_form="defnp" & <br>#1
->anaphor_antecedent #2</tt>
<p>
Using the pointing relation operator <tt>-&gt;</tt> with the
type <tt>anaphor_antecedent</tt>, the first <tt>np_form</tt>, which
should be a personal pronoun (<tt>pper</tt>), is said to be the
anaphor to its antecedent, the second np_form, which is definite
(<tt>defnp</tt>).  To see a visualization of the coreference
relations, open the mmax annotation level in the example corpus. In
the image below, one of the matches for the above query is highlighted
in red (die Seeburger und einige Groß-Glienicker ... sie 'the
Seeburgers and some Groß-Glienickers... they'). Other discourse
referents in the text (marked with an underline) may be clicked on,
causing coreferential chains containing them to be highlighted as
well. Note that discourse referents may overlap, leading to multiple
underlines: Die Seeburger 'the Seeburgers' is a shorter discourse
referent overlapping with the larger one ('the Seeburgers and some
Groß-Glienickers'), and each referent has its own
underline. Annotations of the coreference edges of each relation can
be viewed by hovering of the appropriate underline.

Another way to use pointing relations is found in syntactic dependency trees. The queries in this case can use both pointing relation types and annotations, as in the following query:
</p>
<tt>pos="VVFIN" & tok & #1 ->dep[func="obja"] #2</tt>

<p>
This query searches for a finite verb (with the part-of-speech VVFIN)
and a token, with a pointing relation of the type 'dep' (for
dependency) between the two, annotated with 'func="obja"' (the
function Object, Accusative). The result can be viewed with the
dependency arch visualizer, which shows the verb gibt 'gives' and its
object Wunder 'miracles'.
