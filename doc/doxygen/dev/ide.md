Using an IDE  {#dev-ide}
========

While you can use any text editor of your choice to change ANNIS and compile
it completly on the command line using Maven, a proper IDE will be a huge help
for you. You can use any IDE which has a good support for Maven. The ANNIS
main developers currently recommend the Netbeans 7.x IDE for development.
