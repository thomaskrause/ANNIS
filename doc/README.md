ANNIS Documentation
===================

The documentation is split in three parts:

- User Guide for users of the Web-Frontend and Kickstarter
- Adminstration Guide for administrators of server installations of ANNIS
- Developer Guide for people who want to participate and or extend ANNIS

Build
-----

For the developer documentation you should install Doxygen (http://www.doxygen.org) 
and call "doxygen" in this directory to compile everything.
A pre-compiled version is accessable at http://korpling.github.com/ANNIS .

The User and Adminstration Guide are currently in the Docbook format and can be 
compiled e.g. with the Oxygen XML editor. We plan to switch to the Flat ODT Format
fore these guides.
